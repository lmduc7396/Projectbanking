## Summary of Date/Time Error Fixes

The error you encountered:
```
Column 'GENERATED_DATE' has dtype object, cannot use method 'nlargest' with this dtype
```

**Root Cause:** 
Pandas was treating the `GENERATED_DATE` column as text/object type instead of datetime, so operations like `nlargest()` for finding recent comments failed.

**Fixes Applied:**

### 1. Comment Management Page (`pages/4_ðŸ”§_Comment_Management.py`)
- âœ… **Recent Comments Display**: Convert GENERATED_DATE to datetime before using `nlargest()`
- âœ… **Latest Update Metric**: Proper datetime conversion for finding max date
- âœ… **Timeline Chart**: Safe datetime conversion for daily timeline
- âœ… **Old Comments Deletion**: Error handling for datetime operations

### 2. OpenAI Comment Page (`pages/3_ðŸ¤–_OpenAI_Comment.py`)
- âœ… **Cache Status Display**: Safe date extraction with error handling

### 3. Bulk Generator (`Bulk_Comment_Generator.py`)
- âœ… **Already working correctly**: Saves dates as strings in proper format

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test the fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project
   cd "c:\Users\ducle\OneDrive\Work-related\VS - Code project"
   
   # Run the data structure test
   python Quick_Data_Test.py
   
   # Start your Streamlit app
   streamlit run Github.py
   ```

2. **Test the Comment Management page:**
   - Go to "ðŸ”§ Comment Management" page
   - The error should no longer occur
   - You should see proper date formatting throughout

3. **Run bulk generation (when ready):**
   ```bash
   python Bulk_Comment_Generator.py
   ```

## What Was Fixed

**Before:** 
- Date columns were treated as text
- `nlargest()` and other datetime operations failed
- Inconsistent date handling across pages

**After:**
- Proper datetime conversion where needed
- Error handling for date operations
- Consistent date formatting for display
- Safe fallbacks for malformed dates

The system should now work smoothly without datetime-related errors!
