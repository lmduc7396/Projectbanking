### Comparison Type Explanation

**Three Comparison Perspectives** (for quarterly data only):

1. **T12M (Trailing 12 Months)**:
   - Compares current vs average of last 12 months
   - Smooths seasonality
   - Most stable for trend analysis

2. **QoQ (Quarter-over-Quarter)**:
   - Compares current vs immediately previous quarter
   - Shows short-term momentum
   - Most volatile, sensitive to seasonal effects

3. **YoY (Year-over-Year)**:
   - Compares current vs same quarter last year
   - Eliminates seasonality
   - Standard for quarterly analysis

**Annual Data**: Only has unsuffixed columns (always YoY comparison)

**Impact Score Interpretation**:
All impact scores sum to approximately the PBT growth percentage for their respective comparison type.

Example for Q1 2024:
- PBT_Growth_%_YoY = +20%
- Top_Line_Impact_YoY = +16%
- Cost_Cutting_Impact_YoY = +6%
- Non_Recurring_Impact_YoY = -2%
- Total = 20% ✓

**Calculation Logic**:
1. Calculate Core Earnings:
   - Core TOI = Net Interest Income + Fees Income
   - Core PBT = Core TOI + OPEX + Provision
   - Non-recurring = PBT - Core PBT

2. Compare vs Prior Period (T12M/QoQ/YoY):
   - PBT_Change = Current - Prior
   - Growth_% = (Change / |Prior|) × 100

3. Normalize to Scores (±100%):
   - Top_Line_Score = (Core TOI Change / |PBT Change|) × 100
   - Cost_Score = ((OPEX + Prov Change) / |PBT Change|) × 100
   - Non_Rec_Score = (Non-Rec Change / |PBT Change|) × 100

4. Convert to Impacts (actual %):
   - Top_Line_Impact = (Top_Line_Score × |Growth_%|) / 100

**Special Cases**:
- **Small PBT Adjustment**: If |PBT_Change| < 50B VND, set to 50B to avoid extreme scores (marked with Small_PBT_Flag=1)
- **Score Capping**: Scores capped at ±500% to prevent outliers (marked with Impacts_Capped=1)
- **Loan Impact Approximation**: Loan_Impact = Loan_Growth_% / 2, NIM_Impact = NII_Impact - Loan_Impact

**Example Interpretation**:
> VCB Q1 2024: PBT grew 20% YoY
> - Top_Line_Impact = +16% → Revenue growth contributed 16 percentage points
> - Cost_Cutting_Impact = +6% → Cost management contributed 6 points
> - Non_Recurring_Impact = -2% → One-time charges reduced by 2 points
> - Total = 20% (matches PBT growth)

**Data Quality Notes**:
- First 4 quarters per bank will have NULL impacts (insufficient history for T12M/YoY)
- QoQ only needs 1 prior quarter
- Annual data only has unsuffixed columns (YoY comparison)
- Tier aggregates ('SOCB', 'Sector') calculated same way as individual banks

## Data Quality Notes

### Common Data Patterns
- **NULL handling**: NULL values indicate data not available or not applicable
- **YoY calculations**: First year/quarter will have NULL YoY values
- **Banking aggregates**: TICKER values like 'SOCB' represent tier aggregates
- **Date formats**: Inconsistent across tables - use appropriate conversion

### Data Validation Rules
- All TICKER values should exist in Sector_Map
- Financial metrics should have consistent KEYCODEs
- Banking metrics CA.1-CA.26 follow specific calculation rules
- Ratios bounded by business logic (e.g., NPL typically < 5%)

### Known Limitations
- Historical data starts from 2016 (2017 for banking)
- Some companies may have incomplete quarterly data
- Banking metrics require auxiliary Excel files for full calculations
- Banking earnings drivers require 4+ quarters for T12M/YoY (first quarters NULL)
- Market data updated with 1-day lag

---

## Forecast Data Integration

### Overview
The BankingMetrics table supports both historical and forecast data, distinguished by the ACTUAL column:
- **ACTUAL = 1 (True)**: Historical data from actual financial statements
- **ACTUAL = 0 (False)**: Forecast data from analyst projections

### Forecast Data Source
Forecast data originates from `SIL.W_F_IRIS_FORECAST` table with the following characteristics:
- **Annual Only**: Forecast data has LENGTHREPORT = 5
- **Date Range**: Typically current year and next year (e.g., 2025-2026)
- **KEYCODE Mapping**: Uses IRIS_KEYCODE.csv to map human-readable codes to banking formulas

### Equation Solving
Forecast data often contains high-level metrics that require equation solving:

| Forecast KEYCODE | Formula | Resolution |
|------------------|---------|------------|
| Customer_loan | BS.13+BS.16 | Solver derives BS.16 if BS.13 known |
| CASA | (Nt.121+Nt.124+Nt.125)/Deposit | Complex calculation |
| LDR | Loan/Deposit | Derives Loan if Deposit known |

The pipeline includes an equation solver that:
1. Parses formulas with operations (+, -, *, /)
2. Builds systems of equations from available data
3. Iteratively solves for unknown banking metrics
4. Converts results to standard BS.XX, IS.XX format

### Query Examples with Forecast Data

#### Compare Actual vs Forecast
```sql
SELECT TICKER, YEARREPORT,
       CASE WHEN ACTUAL = 1 THEN 'Historical' ELSE 'Forecast' END as DataType,
       [ROA] as ROA, [ROE] as ROE, [NPL] as NPL_Ratio
FROM BankingMetrics
WHERE TICKER = 'VCB'
  AND YEARREPORT IN (2024, 2025)
ORDER BY YEARREPORT, ACTUAL DESC
```

#### Forecast Trend Analysis
```sql
SELECT TICKER, YEARREPORT,
       [Net Interest Income] as NII,
       [Loan] as TotalLoans,
       [LDR] as LoanDepositRatio
FROM BankingMetrics
WHERE ACTUAL = 0  -- Forecast only
  AND TICKER IN ('VCB', 'CTG', 'TCB')
ORDER BY TICKER, YEARREPORT
